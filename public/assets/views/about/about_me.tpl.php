                    <div class="bio">
                        <p>Born in South of France, I spent the first 20 years of my life working in the hospitality industry arround the world. This experience brought me several skills such as:</p>
                
                        <br>*Customer Service Excellence
                        <br>*Be Ressoucefull
                        <br>*Always meets the expectations<br>
                
                    <br><p>But the Covid-19 pandemic made me realise that I have more to offer as a web developper.</p>
                    <p>This is the reason why I chose to follow a very intensive 6 months training at Ecole O'Clock where I learn several programming languages from the front side (user interface) as well as the back side (server).</p>
                    <p>I specialized on the back side with the framework "symfony".</p>
